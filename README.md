This is (will be) a program to generate an [Anki](http://ankisrs.net)-compatible tab delimited text file from [RIC-7](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/eng/sf01900.html), the [Industry Canada](http://www.ic.gc.ca) question bank for the Basic test in amateur radio. Note that this repo is useless on its own as due to [Crown Copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_copyright#Canada) I can't distribute the *actual* question bank. Please do *not* use the sample questions provided for *any* purpose other than your own amusement as they are, frankly, highly ridiculous.

I'll get around this by making a fake question bank in the form of the text file distributed by the very awesome Francois Daigneault's [ExHAMiner](https://www.rac.ca/en/amateur-radio/beginner-info/exhaminer/) test program. *Eventually*, if this works, I'll have a very [awful](http://mentalfloss.com/article/25638/surprisingly-interesting-history-margarine) complicated recipe for you to use to download ExHAMiner's text yourself and run it through to generate your own text file. Sorry about that. 

Named after [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slick_Rick), natch.
